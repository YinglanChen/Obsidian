##Overview

Obsidian is a new programming language for writing *smart contracts*, which are programs for blockchain platforms.

Obsidian includes two main innovations relative to current languages for these platforms:
1. State-oriented programming lets you declare and transition among states explicitly. Our research suggests that a large fraction of blockchain programs are organized around a high-level state machine.
2. Linear types ensure that important resources managed by your programs are managed correctly. No more accidentally making money vanish into thin air; the compiler will keep you safe.

Obsidian is currently under development and is not ready for general use. For more detail about Obsidian, for now, please read our papers.
