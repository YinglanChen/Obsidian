<h1><strong>Part 3: Ownership -- Miscellaneous </strong></h1>


<h2>Ownership checks</h2>
<p>Ownership can be documented and checked by writing the ownership in brackets. For example, <code>[m@Owned]</code> indicates 
    that <code>m</code> is an owning reference at that particular point in the code. The compiler will generate an error if this 
    might not be the case. For example:
</p>

<pre>
<code>

transaction spend(Money@Owned >> Unowned m) { // m is Owned initially but must be Unowned at the end.
    // implementation not shown
}

transaction testSpend(Money@Owned >> Unowned  m) {
	spend(m); [m@Unowned]; // OK
	[m@Owned]; // COMPILE ERROR: m is Unowned here
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>Ownership checks in <code>[]</code> <strong>never</strong> change ownership; they only document and check what is known.</p>

<br/><br/>
<h2>Getting rid of ownership</h2>
<p>If ownership is no longer desired, <code>disown</code> can be used to relinquish ownership. For example:</p>
<pre>
<code>
contract Money {
    int amount;

    transaction merge(Money@Owned >> Unowned mergeFrom) {
        amount += mergeFrom.amount;
        disown mergeFrom; // We absorbed the value of mergeFrom, so the owner doesn't own it anymore.
    }
}
</code>
</pre>

<br/><br/>
<h2>Invoking transactions</h2>
<p> The compiler checks each invocation to make sure it is permitted according to the ownership of the transaction arguments. For example:</p>

<pre>
<code>
transaction spend(Money@Owned >> Unowned m) {
	// implementation not shown
};
transaction print(Money@Unowned m) {
    // implementation not shown
}

transaction test() {
	Money m = ... // assume m is now owned.
	print(m); // m is still Owned
	spend(m); // m is now Unowned
	spend(m); // COMPILE ERROR: spend() requires Owned input, but m is Unowned here
}
</code>
</pre>

<br/><br/>
<h2>Handling Errors</h2>
<p>Errors can be flagged with <code>revert</code>. A description of the error can be provided as well. An example of usage is given below.</p>
<pre>
    <code>
    transaction checkAmount(Money@Unowned m) {
        if (m.getAmount() < 0) {
            revert("Money must have an amount greater than 0");
        }
    }
    </code>
    </pre>
