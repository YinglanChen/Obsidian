<h1><strong>Part 1: Ownership</strong></h1>
 <!-- local variables never include annotatations. Params and fields always do. -->
<p>Our new programming language is object-oriented. It includes <em>contracts</em>, which are like classes, which can have <em>fields</em> 
    and <em>transactions</em>, which are analogous to functions. 
    In addition, of the many <strong>variables</strong> or <strong>fields</strong> that reference objects, exactly <strong>one</strong> of them 
    can own the object, as seen in diagram <strong>(a)</strong> below. An object can have any number of Unowned references, and, if the object is not Owned, 
    it can have any number of Shared references (shown in <strong>(b)</strong> below). An object with Shared references can also have Unowned references,
    but not Owned ones.
</p>

<p> Here is an example of a contract (a <code>Wallet</code>) with an object (in this case a <code>Money</code>) that has one <code>Owned</code> reference: </p>
<pre>
<code>
contract Money {
}

<strong>contract</strong> Wallet {
    Money@Owned m; // @Owned indicates that the reference m owns the object it refers to
    
    transaction spendMoney() {
        ...
    }
}
</code>
</pre>


<p>The compiler tracks ownership of each variable every time the variable is used. This information is part of the <em>type</em> of the variable. For example, the type of <code>m</code> is <code>Money@Owned</code>. Information about ownership is NOT available at runtime; it is only available during compilation.</p>

<ul>
    <li>If a reference is the only one that holds ownership, then it is <code>Owned</code>.</li>
    <li>If all references to the object are the same (there is no owner), then each reference is <code>Shared</code>.</li>
    <li>If a reference is NOT the owning one, but there might be another owning reference, then the reference is <code>Unowned</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Method return types</h3>
<p>
When transactions return objects, the types must be annotated in the function header. For example:
<pre>
<code>
transaction withdraw() returns Money@Owned {
    // body not shown
}
</code>
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Method parameters</h3>
<p>When a reference is passed to a transaction as an argument, the transaction's declaration specifies initial and final ownership with <code>>></code>. For example:</p>

<pre>
<code>
transaction spend(Money@Owned >> Unowned m) { // m is Owned initially but must be Unowned at the end.
	// implementation not shown
};

transaction testSpend(Money@Owned >> Unowned m) {
	spend(m);
	// m is now of type Money@Unowned due to specification on spend() declaration.
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>If a transaction expects an argument that is <code>Unowned</code>, this means that the transaction cannot take ownership. As a result, it is safe to pass an <code>Owned</code> reference as an argument to a transaction that expects an <code>Unowned</code> argument. After the transaction returns, the caller still holds ownership.</p>

<p>If a transaction parameter lacks >>, then ownership will not change. For example, <code>transaction test(Money@Owned m)</code> is equivalent to <code>transaction test(Money@Owned >> Owned m)</code>. <code>transaction foo(Money@Unowned m)</code> can accept a <code>Money</code> reference with any ownership and the caller maintains whatever ownership it had initially when it called that transaction.

    <h3>Method receivers (<code>this</code>)</h3>
    <p>Sometimes the ownership of <code>this</code> needs to change in a transaction. That fact can be specified by adding <code>this</code> as the first argument in the transaction declaration. For example:</p>
    
    <pre>
    <code>
    contract Money {
        transaction discard(Money@Owned >> Unowned this) {
            disown this;
        }
    }
    
    contract Wallet {
        transaction throwAwayMoney(Money @ Owned >> Unowned money) {
            money.discard(); // 'this' argument is implicit; do not include it in transaction call.
        }
    }
    </code>
    </pre>
