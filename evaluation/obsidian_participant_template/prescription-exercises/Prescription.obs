/*
 * This system is intended to reflect the following rule on prescriptions:
 *    A prescription cannot be filled more times than the designated number of refills specifies.
 *    Prescription-filling is implemented in Prescription.doFill().
 *
 * However, the Drug Enforcement Agency is worried that the code below might allow violations of the rule by
 * malevolent patients, who might modify or subclass the Patient contract.
 * Specifically, it is possible for a caller to call depositPrescription() several times 
 * with the same prescription object. 
 * 
 * TASK 1: Please use what you have learned today to fix this problem (avoiding runtime checks if possible).
