<h2>Part 2: States</h2>

<p>In our new programming language, contracts can define <em>states</em>. For example, a <code>LightSwitch</code> is always either <code>Off</code> or <code>On</code> (never both):</p>

<pre>
<code>
contract LightSwitch {
  state On;
  state Off;
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>Methods, including constructors, can change the state of <code>this</code> with the <code>-></code> operator:</p>

<pre>
<code>
  LightSwitch() { // constructor
    ->Off; // Transition to Off state.
  }
</code>
</pre>

<p>Methods can specify what states the object must be in before they can be invoked and what states the object will be in after they exit by annotating the <code>this</code> parameter. Constructors can specify what state they end in.</p>

<pre>
<code>
  LightSwitch@Off() { // constructor always ends with the object in Off state
    ->Off;
  }

  transaction turnOn(LightSwitch@Off >> On this) // turnOn() can only be called on objects that are in Off state.
  {
    ->On;
  }

  transaction turnOff(LightSwitch@On >> Off this)
  {
    ->Off;
  }
</code>
</pre>

<p>Each object can have one reference that statically specifies what state the object is in. For example, <code>LightSwitch@On</code> is the type of a variable that refers to a switch that is in <code>On</code> state.</p> Note that this is an extension of <em>ownership</em>: like ownership, one reference is special. The compiler keeps track of the possible states an object can be in and makes sure that the specifications are observed. For example:

<pre>
<code>
transaction foo() {
    LightSwitch s = new LightSwitch();
    s.turnOn();
}
</code>
</pre>

The compiler checks transaction invocations to make sure they are safe:

<pre>
<code>
transaction foo() {
    LightSwitch s = new LightSwitch();
    s.turnOff(); // COMPILE ERROR: turnOff() requires that s is On, but here s is Off
}
</code>
</pre>

<h3>Optional compiler checks</h3>
<p>As before, the programmer can use <code>[]</code> statements to check state information at compile time. For example, <code>[s@Off];</code> will cause a compiler error if <code>s</code> does not refer to an object in <code>Off</code> state.</p>

<h3>Unowned references</h3>
When there may be an owner of an object, other references cannot be used to modify the state.  These other references are annotated <code>Unowned</code>. For example:

<pre>
<code>
transaction foo(LightSwitch@Unowned s) {
    s.turnOff(); // COMPILE ERROR: can't change state of s through an unowned reference
}
</code>
</pre>

<h3>Shared references</h3>
If there is no owner of an object, then all references to the object are annotated <code>Shared</code>. These references can be used to change the state of the referenced object, but invoking transactions that can only be called in some states requires a runtime check. For example:

<pre>
<code>
transaction test1(LightSwitch@Shared s) {
    s.turnOn(); // COMPILE ERROR: turnOn requires that s be Off, but s is Shared.
}
</code>
</pre>

In the above situation, the programmer might need to check the state dynamically with <code>if...in</code>.

<h3>Testing states with <code>is</code></h3>
<pre>
<code>
transaction test2(LightSwitch@Shared s) {
    if (s in On) { // runtime check to see whether the object referenced by s is in state On
        s.turnOff(); // OK due to runtime check
    }

}
</code>
</pre>

<p>Within the scope of the <code>if...in</code> block, the compiler requires that if there <string>is</strong> an owner of the object referenced by <code>s</code>, then the owner's state specification is never violated. If it is, then the program is terminated; it is up to the programmer to make sure the body of the <code>if is</code> block does not change the state inappropriately.</p>

<h3>Implicit casts</h3>
<p>When a <code>Shared</code> reference is needed, an <code>Owned</code> suffices as long as the reference is NOT to an asset. For example, an <code>Owned</code> reference can be passed as an argument to a transaction that expects a <code>Shared</code> reference to a non-resource object. However, the caller is left with a <code>Shared</code> reference.</p>

<p>When an <code>Unowned</code> reference is needed, any reference suffices, and the caller is left with their original kind of reference.</p>
