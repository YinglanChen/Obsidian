<h1>Part 7: States -- Miscellaneous</h1>



<h2>Unowned references</h2>
When there may be an owner of an object, other references cannot be used to modify the state.  These other references are annotated <code>Unowned</code>. For example:

<pre>
<code>
transaction foo(LightSwitch@Unowned s) {
    s.turnOff(); // COMPILE ERROR: can't change state of s through an unowned reference
}
</code>
</pre>

<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Shared references</h2>
If there is no owner of an object, then all references to the object are annotated <code>Shared</code>. These references can be used to change the state of the referenced object, but invoking transactions that can only be called in some states requires a runtime check. For example:

<pre>
<code>
transaction test1(LightSwitch@Shared s) {
    s.turnOn(); // COMPILE ERROR: turnOn requires that s be Off, but s is Shared.
}
</code>
</pre>

In the above situation, the programmer might need to check the state dynamically with <code>if...in</code>.

<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Implicit casts</h2>
<p>When a <code>Shared</code> reference is needed, an <code>Owned</code> suffices as long as the reference is NOT to an asset. For example, an <code>Owned</code> reference can be passed as an argument to a transaction that expects a <code>Shared</code> reference to a non-resource object. However, the caller is left with a <code>Shared</code> reference.</p>

<p>When an <code>Unowned</code> reference is needed, any reference suffices, and the caller is left with their original kind of reference.</p>
