<h1><strong>Part 3: Assets</strong></h1>

<p>Some owning references are to things that should not be accidentally lost. To prevent accidental loss, we can declare contracts 
    with the keyword <code>asset</code>. Let's do this for <code>Money</code>:</p>

<pre>
<code>
asset contract Money {
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>Now, if we accidentally lose track of an owning reference to a <code>Money</code> object (by letting it go out of scope without transferring ownership to somewhere else, such as a field), the compiler will give an error:

<pre>
<code>
transaction test() {
    Money m = ...; [m@Owned]; // OK, m is Owned here
    // ERROR: cannot drop reference to owned asset m
}
</code>
</pre>

We can fix this by (for example) returning m, assigning it to an owning field, or passing it as an argument to an appropriate transaction. For example:

<pre>
<code>
transaction test() returns Money@Owned {
    Money m = ...; [m@Owned]; // OK, m is Owned here
    return m; // gives ownership of m to the caller of test()
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>Note that non-owning references to <code>Money</code> are not restricted; the compiler gives no errors when they go out of scope.</p>
