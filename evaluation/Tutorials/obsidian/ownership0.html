<h1><strong>Part 0: Ownership -- The Concept</strong></h1>
 <!-- local variables never include annotatations. Params and fields always do. -->
<p>Our new programming language is object-oriented. It includes <em>contracts</em>, which are like classes, and can have <em>fields</em> 
    and <em>transactions</em>, analogous to member variables and functions respectively. As in other object-oriented languages,
    there must be exactly one <code>main contract</code>.
    In addition, of the many variables or fields that reference objects, exactly <strong>one</strong> of them 
    can own the object, as seen in diagram <strong>(a)</strong> below. An object can have any number of Unowned references, and, if the object is not Owned, 
    it can have any number of Shared references (shown in <strong>(b)</strong> below). An object with Shared references can also have Unowned references,
    but not Owned ones.

<p>
    In other words, the concept of ownership is having different types of references to an object. There are three different 
    types these references: <code>Owned</code>, <code>Unowned</code>, and <code>Shared</code>.
    Let's use money as an example. If you have $10, that money belongs to you -- you own it. This is the idea of an <code>Owned</code> reference.
    You can show this money to anyone else; they can see the money, and talk about it, but they can't do anything with it -- 
    they can't spend it, or save it, or add to it because it's not theirs. This is the idea of an <code>Unowned</code> reference; it's a reference to an object,
    but doesn't have as much manipulative power over the object because it doesn't own the object. Now imagine the $10 is in a public pot that anyone can take from. 
    In this case, everyone shares ownership of the money; i.e., you all have <code>Shared</code> references to it. <code>Shared</code> references 
    are similar to normal references in other programming languages, and are the default ownership type if no permission is specified.
</p>

<h3>Note that ownership ONLY applies to objects; primitive types (like ints, strings, booleans, etc.) do NOT have permissions.</h3>

<br/>
<p> Continuing with money, here is an example of a contract (a <code>Wallet</code>) with an object, a <code>Money</code> contract, 
    that has one <code>Owned</code> reference: </p>
<pre>
<code>
contract Money {
}

main <strong>contract</strong> Wallet {
    Money@Owned m; // @Owned indicates that the reference m owns the object it refers to
    
    transaction spendMoney() {
        ...
    }
}
</code>
</pre>

Note that with this code alone, <code>m</code> is an <code>Owned</code> reference that doesn't actually point to any object. If we wanted to create a new object,
we would do it in a similar way to other object-oriented languages: <code>m = new Money()</code>. Now, <code>m</code> is an Owned reference pointing to a 
<code>Money</code> object.
<br/><br/>

<p>The compiler tracks ownership of each variable every time the variable is used. This information is part of the <em>type</em> of the variable. For example, the type of <code>m</code> is <code>Money@Owned</code>. Information about ownership is NOT available at runtime; it is only available during compilation.</p>

<ul>
    <li>If a reference is the only one that holds ownership, then it is <code>Owned</code>.</li>
    <li>If all references to the object are the same (there is no owner), then each reference is <code>Shared</code>.</li>
    <li>If a reference is NOT the owning one, but there might be another owning reference, then the reference is <code>Unowned</code>.</li>
</ul>
