<h1>Part 5: States</h1>

<p>In our new programming language, contracts can define <em>states</em>. For example, a <code>LightSwitch</code> is always 
  either <code>Off</code> or <code>On</code> (never both):</p>

<pre>
<code>
contract LightSwitch {
  state On;
  state Off;
}
</code>
</pre>

<p> In addition, fields can be specified to be available only within certain states. For example: </p>
<pre>
<code>
contract LightSwitch {
    state On {
      int brightness;
    }
    state Off;

    int switchLocation available in On, Off;
}
</code>
</pre>
<p>In the example above, <code>brightness</code> can only be accessed and used when a <code>LightSwitch</code> is in the <code>On</code> state.
    On the other hand, <code>switchLocation</code> can be accessed and used in both <code>On</code> and <code>Off</code>, but couldn't be 
    accessed in any other states if they existed.</p>

  <br/>
  <h2>States and Ownership</h2>
  <p>Each object can have one reference that statically specifies what state the object is in. For example, 
    <code>LightSwitch@On</code> is the type of a variable that refers to a switch that is in <code>On</code> state.
  </p> 
    Note that this is an extension of <em>ownership</em>: like ownership, one reference is special. The compiler keeps track 
    of the possible states an object can be in and makes sure that the specifications are observed. For example:
  
  <pre>
  <code>
  transaction foo() {
      LightSwitch s = new LightSwitch(); //Assume a LightSwitch is in Off upon instantiation
      s.turnOn();
  }
  </code>
  </pre>
  
  The compiler checks transaction invocations to make sure they are safe:
  
  <pre>
  <code>
  transaction foo() {
      LightSwitch s = new LightSwitch(); //Assume a LightSwitch is in Off upon instantiation
      s.turnOff(); // COMPILE ERROR: turnOff() requires that s is On, but here s is Off
  }
  </code>
  </pre>
  
  <strong> NOTE: there is never a need to specify both <em>ownership</em> and <em>state</em> at the same time; 
        if a field is in any state, it must be Owned, and if Unowned, the field cannot have a state. </strong>

<br/>
<br/>
<h2>States and Assets</h2>
<p> States can also be declared as <code>asset</code>s, which means the contract is an asset (see Part 4) only when in that state.
    For example, see an alternate definition of <code>LightSwitch</code> below, in which a <code>LightSwitch</code> is an  <code>asset</code> only
    when it is turned <code>On</code>. </p>

    <pre>
    <code>
    contract LightSwitch {
      asset state On;
      state Off;
    }
    </code>
    </pre>
