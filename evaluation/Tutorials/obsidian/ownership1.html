<h1><strong>Part 1: Ownership -- Transactions </strong></h1>
<h2>Transaction return types</h2>
<p>
When transactions return objects, the type of the returned object must be annotated in the transaction declaration. For example:
<pre>
<code>
transaction withdraw() returns Money@Owned {
    // body not shown
    return m; //where m is of type Money@Owned
}
</code>
</pre>
If we did not return <code>m</code> within the transaction, or if <code>m</code> was not of type <code>Money@Owned</code>, we would get an error.
</p>

<br/>
<h2>Transaction parameters</h2>
<p>When a reference is passed to a transaction as an argument, the transaction's declaration specifies initial and final ownership with <code>>></code>. 
    If <code>>></code> is not specified for a certain parameter, then the ownership of that parameter <b>doesn't change</b>. For example:</p>

<pre>
<code>
transaction spend(Money@Owned >> Unowned m) { // m is Owned initially but must be Unowned at the end.
	// implementation not shown
};

transaction testSpend(Money@Owned >> Unowned m) {
	spend(m);
	// m is now of type Money@Unowned due to specification on spend() declaration.
}

transaction foo(Money@Owned m) { //this is the equivalent to Money@Owned >> Owned m
    // body not shown
    
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>If a transaction expects an argument that is <code>Unowned</code>, this means that the transaction cannot take ownership. 
    As a result, it is safe to pass an <code>Owned</code> reference as an argument to a transaction that expects an <code>Unowned</code> argument. 
    After the transaction returns, the caller still holds ownership.</p>

<p> 
    For example, <code>transaction bar(Money@Unowned m)</code> can accept a 
    <code>Money</code> reference with any ownership and the caller maintains whatever ownership it had initially when it called that transaction.
</p>


<br/>
<h2>Transaction receivers (<code>this</code>)</h2>
<p>Sometimes the ownership of <code>this</code> (the ownership of this contract) needs to change in a transaction. 
    That can be specified by adding <code>this</code> as the first argument in the transaction declaration. Note that <code>this</code> is implicit,
    and is not an actual parameter. For example:</p>

<pre>
<code>
contract Money {
    transaction discard(Money@Owned >> Unowned this) {
        disown this;
    }
}

contract Wallet {
    transaction throwAwayMoney(Money@Owned >> Unowned money) {
        money.discard(); // 'this' argument is implicit; do not include it in transaction call.
    }
}
</code>
</pre>
