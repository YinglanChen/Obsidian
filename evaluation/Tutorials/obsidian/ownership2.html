<h1><strong>Part 2: Ownership -- Variables</strong></h1>

<h2>Assignment</h2>
<p>Assignment (<code>=</code>) transfers ownership. That is, the variable on the left becomes the <strong>new</strong> owner, and the variable on the right loses ownership. For example:</p>

<pre>
<code>
Money m = ...; // m is Owned
Money newMoney = m; // m is Unowned, and newMoney is Owned
// Now m is of type Money@Unowned, not Money@Owned.
</code>
</pre>

<br/>
<h2>Fields</h2>
<p><strong>Field declarations</strong>&nbsp;MUST include ownership specifications. 
    This means that&nbsp;at the END of each transaction, the permission (ownership status) of the object the field references MUST 
    match the annotation on the field when it was <b>declared</b>. For example:</p>
<pre>
<code>
contract Wallet {
	Money@Owned money; // Note that this annotation is on a field declaration!

	// exchange removes (and returns) the current contents of the Wallet, replacing it with the input Money.
	transaction exchange(Money@Owned >> Unowned otherMoney) returns Money@Owned {
        Money temporaryMoney = money;
        money = otherMoney;
        return temporaryMoney;
	}
}
</code>
</pre>
NOTE: in the above example, <code>money</code> becomes <code>Unowned</code> in the <code>exchange</code> transaction when the ownership 
is transferred to <code>temporaryMoney</code>. However, by the end of the transaction, <code>money</code> gets ownership of <code>otherMoney</code>,
so its permission at the end of the transaction still matches its permission where it was declared (as a field).

<br/><br/>
<h2>Local variables</h2>
Local variables (variables declared within transactions) are declared <strong>WITHOUT</strong> any ownership specified; 
instead, you can optionally write compiler ownership checks <code>[]</code> to specify their ownership. 
The compiler will output an error if the ownership does not match the check. For example:
<pre>
<code>
transaction withdraw() returns Money@Owned {
    // body not shown
}

transaction test() {
    Money m = withdraw(); [m@Owned];
    spend(m); [m@Unowned];
    [m@Owned]; // COMPILE ERROR: m is Unowned here
</code>
</pre>

<br/><br/>
<h2>Constructors</h2>
<p>Constructors are specified just like in other object-oriented languages, but can include a permission. 
    Fields of a contract must be initialized in the constructor. For example:</p>
<pre>
    <code>
    contract Wallet {
        Money@Owned money; // Note that this annotation is on a field declaration!
    
        //Constructor, takes in a Money parameter
        Wallet@Owned(Money@Owned >> Unowned initialMoney) {
            money = initialMoney;
        }
    }
    </code>
    </pre>
